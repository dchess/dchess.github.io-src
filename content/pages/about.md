## Former Teacher Turned Software Engineer

I got started programming in BASIC on a used Commodore64 in the early 90s. I
quickly found my way to HTML4 and built some of my first websites on GeoCities.

In college I tried my hand at Computer Science, but was more and more
attracted to the Social Sciences and eventually ended up teaching High
School Social Studies. 

I soon needed better tools to support my students and started building out some
simple web apps to help me teach in the days before blended learning and EdTech 
were ubiquitous in the education sector. 

After a few years of building my skills, I eventually found myself working for [Aspire
Public Schools](http://aspirepublicschools.org) on the Godzilla team alongside the folks
who went on to start [Schoolzilla](http://schoolzilla.com). I've been hacking away ever 
since building data integrations and web applications to support our students, teachers, 
and back-office staff.

I'm a polyglot programmer with a deep understanding of data integrations, data warehousing,
and back-end APIs. I'm a decent full stack developer when it comes to enterprise web apps
and have been shifting our company to standardize on a Python stack these days.

## Skills

- **Front End**: HTML5/CSS3/ES6, SASS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Material Design
- **Back End**: Python, DJango, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, C#, MS SQL, PostgreSQL
- **Scripting**: Bash, PowerShell, Python, Ruby
- **DevOps**: VirtualBox, Heroku, AWS, S3, Docker

## Interests

I am an avid homebrewer and will wax philosophical on the merits of late boil 
hop additions if given the chance. But I'm also happy to enjoy some lawn-mower
beer while sitting on the patio.

More and more, lately, I've been getting into endurance cycling and am setting a
goal for myself to ride my first century (100 mile) this year.

I'm still a teacher at heart and look for any opportunity to share what I
know with others. At my day-job I run several professional development groups
to support non-developers in learning SQL and Python.

I'm also a husband and father and love nothing better than sitting around playing
legos with my son. He's still young, but I'm really looking forward to sharing the
joy of programming with him when he's a little older.
