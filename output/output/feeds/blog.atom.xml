I originally published it to test out &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and to put
something basic on my personal domain. I was working with Ruby on Rails at the time
and Jekyll seemed the natural choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intervening time, my work has shifted and we are more and more aligning on
standardizing our entire stack to be Python based (the advantages of which, I will
expound upon in another post). With that has come a desire to teach more of my
colleagues (particularly those not directly involved in programming) to take
advantage of Python in their work. Data analysts can leverage it for data science
and predictive analytics work and back-office folks like our accountants and financial
analysts can leverage it for task automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been getting requests from some friends and family to teach them a bit of
programming and Python seems like a natural choice for beginners. With that in mind,
I've made it my New Year's resolution to teach as many people as possible this year 
to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm rebooting my blog to post helpful resources and connect with folks interested in 
learning and that means giving my site a much needed boost of new energy. I've rebuilt
it from the ground up in &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; so that it'll
be in Python as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to 2018, the year of Python!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
